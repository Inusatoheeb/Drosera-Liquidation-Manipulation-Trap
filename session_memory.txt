Also make sure what we build at the end of the day is in accordance with these https://dev.drosera.io/litepaper/, https://dev.drosera.io/.

Now I previously developed the below trap idea to an extent, but I knew nothing about how to structure it so it would work well. So we are going to be redeveloping this trap idea.

# Drosera — Liquidation Manipulation Trap (PoC)

A minimal, demo-ready Drosera trap that detects **liquidation manipulation** attempts and records them on-chain via a `BaitResponse` contract that implements `executeBytes(bytes)`.

This repo is purposely small so you can demo the idea quickly: mempool watcher → detection heuristics → encoded bytes → `executeBytes(bytes)` on-chain record.

### What's included
- `contracts/BaitResponse.sol` — response contract that decodes bytes and emits an event.
- `contracts/FlashBait.sol` — example trap contract (Foundry) that would run on-chain in a Drosera context.
- `operator/watcher.js` — mempool watcher that encodes the payload and calls `executeBytes(bytes)` on the response contract.
- `scripts/demo-send-tx.js` — simulate malicious tx locally (Hardhat fork recommended).
- `drosera.toml` — manifest for Drosera (points to `executeBytes(bytes)`).

### Tech stack
- Solidity ^0.8.17
- Foundry (for contract compile & deploy) — optional, you can use Hardhat instead
- Node.js + ethers.js for operator watcher

---

## Quickstart (local fork + demo)

1. Install deps

```bash
# Foundry (optional)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Node deps
npm init -y
npm i ethers dotenv

2. Deploy BaitResponse (Foundry or Hardhat)



Foundry (recommended): forge script deploy/DeployBaitResponse.s.sol:DeployBaitResponse --rpc-url <RPC> --broadcast


3. Configure operator/config.json with your RPC and deployed baitResponseAddress.


4. Run watcher



node operator/watcher.js

5. Simulate a liquidation-style tx (on a local fork)



node scripts/demo-send-tx.js

6. Watch the watcher console and the FlashCaught events emitted by BaitResponse.

How to present this in an application

Short explanation (2 lines): what the attack is, what the trap does (mempool monitor + executeBytes(bytes) response), and where to verify (paste trap address + response address).

Include a short GIF that shows watcher log -> tx hash -> event on block explorer (or forge test output).

contracts/BaitResponse.sol

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

contract BaitResponse {
    address public owner;

    event FlashCaught(address indexed reporter, bytes32 indexed txHash, string reason, uint256 timestamp);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Generic entrypoint Drosera expects: accepts bytes and acts on them.
    // For PoC we'll decode: (bytes32 txHash, string reason)
    function executeBytes(bytes calldata data) external {
        // Expected encoding: abi.encode(txHash, reason)
        (bytes32 txHash, string memory reason) = abi.decode(data, (bytes32, string));
        emit FlashCaught(msg.sender, txHash, reason, block.timestamp);
    }

    // Administrative helper
    function setOwner(address _owner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = _owner;
    }
}

Notes: executeBytes(bytes) is intentionally generic. Drosera uses encoded bytes so different traps can pass structured payloads.

operator/watcher.js (complete — encodes bytes and calls executeBytes)

const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const fs = require('fs');
const config = require('./config.json');
require('dotenv').config();

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(config.provider);
const operatorKey = config.operatorPrivateKey;
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(operatorKey, provider);

const baitAbi = ["function executeBytes(bytes calldata data) external"];
const bait = new ethers.Contract(config.baitResponseAddress, baitAbi, signer);

// Simple selectors / patterns to watch for: replace with real selectors and ABIs in prod
const KNOWN_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESSES = config.lendingPools || [];

function looksLargeBorrow(tx) {
  try {
    const value = tx.value ? ethers.BigNumber.from(tx.value) : ethers.BigNumber.from(0);
    return value.gte(ethers.BigNumber.from(config.minBorrowAmountWei || '0'));
  } catch (e) { return false; }
}

async function processPending(txHash) {
  try {
    const tx = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
    if (!tx || !tx.to) return;

    const to = tx.to.toLowerCase();

    // Heuristic: if to is a known lending pool, or if value/borrow large
    if (KNOWN_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESSES.map(a => a.toLowerCase()).includes(to) || looksLargeBorrow(tx)) {
      console.log(`⚠️ Suspicious pending tx: ${txHash} -> ${tx.to}`);
      const reason = `Suspicious liquidation-manip pattern: to=${tx.to}`;
      const txHashBytes = ethers.utils.hexlify(ethers.utils.randomBytes(32));
      const encoded = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(["bytes32","string"], [txHashBytes, reason]);

      // Call executeBytes on BaitResponse (simulate Drosera response)
      const sent = await bait.executeBytes(encoded, { gasLimit: 200000 });
      console.log('BaitResponse tx sent:', sent.hash);
    }

  } catch (err) {
    console.error('processPending error', err);
  }
}

provider.on('pending', (txHash) => {
  processPending(txHash);
});

console.log('Watcher started — listening to pending mempool...');

Notes:

This PoC calls executeBytes(bytes) directly on the BaitResponse contract to mimic the Drosera network's response. In a real Drosera trap the operator would submit the encoded response to Drosera, which performs the call according to drosera.toml rules.

Use ABI decoding and selector lists for better accuracy in production.

Mempool watcher → heuristics for large borrows & complex calldata → executeBytes(bytes) response = immutable on-chain evidence.

Longer PR description

> This PR introduces the Drosera Liquidation Manipulation Trap: an on-chain / on-mempool defense that detects suspicious liquidation patterns in-flight and creates an immutable on-chain record via an executeBytes(bytes)-style response contract. The PoC includes a mempool watcher, Foundry deploy scripts for the response contract, and a demo script to reproduce detection on a local fork.

END OF TRAP DEVELOPMENT

Take a look at the above and make a folder with a package.json in the folder and wait for furter instructions while I initialize the trap foundry template so you can understand the basic structure of a trap on drosera.

Understand that when we get to the development stage, the proof-of-concept (PoC) trap idea must be built, tested and verified without the use of a frontend dApp but verified transactions that are recorded on the Ethereum Hoodi Network blockchain.

Write the memory files (our queries) into the same folder you create and wait for further instructions.
